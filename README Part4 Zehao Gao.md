# Matrix calculator
## Background analysis
Matrix operation belongs to higher algebra. Mathematical analysis, analytical geometry are involved. 
Students in most majors will study this content, but the intensity is different.
Engineering is bound to be related to geometry, and involves some complex calculations. 
Matrix operation is used in calculating complex advanced mathematics, which has natural advantages.

In architectural engineering design, including most of the building environment calculation, will involve
a large number of matrix operations, so if there is a fast and compact matrix calculator, it will make 
the work efficiency twice the result with half the effort.

## Main function
This calculator mainly realizes the following functions:

Matrix addition

Matrix multiplication

Matrix dot product

Inverse of matrix

At the same time, the calculator has the ability to detect exceptions in the case of user misoperation, such as:

The input is not standardized when the pop-up alert.

Multiple ";" at the end will automatically process.


## Using method

Matrix input form: 
    input a line of characters, using ";" to separate, representing a row of the matrix.  
    Each row is separated by a space, representing a column of the matrix.
    
For example:

1 2 3 ; 4 5 6;7 8 9

Representing the following matrix:
[1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9]

The matrix calculator can calculate: 
1 Matrix addition 
2 Matrix multiplication 
3 Matrix dot product 
4 Inverse of matrix 
Output is presented in matrix form
